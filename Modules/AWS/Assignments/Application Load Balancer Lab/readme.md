# Application Load Balancer Lab

## Objective
Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with two EC2 instances behind it. Ensure security group (SG) configurations allow only ALB access to EC2 instances while preventing direct access.

---

## 1. Launch the EC2 Instances
- Go to EC2 in the AWS console and launch instances
- Select Ubuntu as the AMI
- Install NGINX on the first instance

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Update system & install Nginx
yum update -y && amazon-linux-extras enable nginx1 && yum install -y nginx -y

# Start and enable Nginx
systemctl start nginx && systemctl enable nginx

# Remove default Nginx page
rm -f /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

# Get instance details
INSTANCE_ID=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id)
AVAIL_ZONE=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)
SERVER_NAME=$(hostname -A)

# Create a simple HTML page
cat > /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html <<EOF
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>EC2 Info</title></head>
<body style="font-family: Arial; text-align: center; padding: 50px;">
    <h1>EC2 Instance Details</h1>
    <p><strong>Server Name:</strong> $SERVER_NAME</p>
    <p><strong>Instance ID:</strong> $INSTANCE_ID</p>
    <p><strong>Availability Zone:</strong> $AVAIL_ZONE</p>
</body>
</html>
EOF

# Restart Nginx
systemctl restart nginx
```

- AWS will assign a VPC to this instance automatically
- Launch another instance and repeat the same steps ensuring both EC2 instances are in the same VPC and AZ

---

## 2. Create Application Load Balancer
### Create ALB:
- Go to the Load Balancers section in AWS
- Create a new Application Load Balancer
- Assign a name
- Enable IPv4 Addressing
- Select the same VPC as your EC2 instances
- Select the same Availability Zone where your EC2 instances are located

### Configure SG for ALB:
- Create a Security Group (SG) for ALB
- Allow inbound traffic
  - Port 80 (HTTP) from the internet
  - Port 443 (HTTPS) from the internet

### Configure Listeners and Routing:
1. Ensure HTTP (port 80) is set up
2. Create a Target Group
   - Target Type: Instances
   - Name: Choose a unique name
   - IP Version: IPv4
   - VPC: Same as EC2 instances
   - Protocol: HTTP/1
   - Health Check Path: /index.html
3. Assign EC2 instances to the Target Group
4. Set the Target Group as the Default Action
5. Create the Load Balancer

### Configure SG for EC2:
- Create a Security Group (SG) for EC2 instances
- Allow inbound traffic only from the ALB SG
  - Port 80 (HTTP) from ALB SG
  - Port 443 (HTTPS) from ALB SG

---

## 3. Implement Auto Scaling Group (ASG) for EC2 Instances
### Create a Launch Template:
- Select one of the existing EC2 instances
- Create a Launch Template from the instance

### Create ASG:
- Create a new Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
- Select the Launch Template created earlier
- Select the same VPC and AZ as the EC2 instances
- Choose Balanced Best Effort to distribute instances across zones
- Attach the ALB created earlier and enable ELB Health Checks
- Set minimum and maximum instance counts
- Create the Auto Scaling Group

---

## 4. Configure HTTPS Listeners and SSL Certificate
1. Go to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
2. Click Request a Certificate and choose Public Certificate
3. Enter your domain name
4. Choose DNS Validation
5. Request the certificate and update CNAME records in your domainâ€™s DNS settings
6. Wait for AWS to validate and issue the certificate
7. Go to your ALB navigate to Listeners and add a listener
8. Select Protocol: HTTPS (port 443)
9. Select your SSL Certificate from ACM
10. Save the configuration

---

## Conclusion
You have successfully deployed an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with EC2 instances an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and HTTPS with an SSL Certificate

Happy Deploying ðŸš€
